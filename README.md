# IMPORTANT READ THIS FIRST BEFORE BUILDING OR DOWNLOADING A RELEASE ABOUT SEED PHRASE IMPORT / EXPORT BETWEEN VERIONS https://github.com/bitnet-io/electrum-bitnet-4.2.2/blob/main/note-about-private-keys.txt

## WHAT IS WORKING WHAT IS NOT WORKING BETWEEN DIFFERENT VERSIONS

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO EXPORT SEED PHRASE FROM 4.2.2 DESKTOP and IMPORT INTO 4.2.2 android

when sending a transaction using the camera IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SCAN A QR CODE USING THE ANDROID 4.2.2 VERSION FROM A DESKTOP VERSION 4.2.2 (but 4.2.2 android will scan 4.1.5 receving address segwit QR codes fine)

so that two wallets are linked:: IT IS POSSIBLE TO EXPORT A WALLET ADDRESS PRIVATE KEY FROM 4.2.2 android and import the private key receving address into 4.2.2 desktop (4.2.2 android and 4.1.5 android do not support import of private keys only export of private keys)










# 11-23-2021 working send / receive 
# 11-23-2021 (fixed server side , HAD no BIT to test binance.us delay up to 5 days?)

# need to adjust main QR code workaround 
# todo -> remove ?time= date by unix epoch from address URI label
```
date +%s

## Getting started

_(If you've come here looking to simply run Electrum,
[you may download it here](https://github.com/bitnet-io/electrum-bitnet/releases).)_

Electrum itself is pure Python, and so are most of the required dependencies,
but not everything. The following sections describe how to run from source, but here
is a TL;DR:

```
$ sudo apt-get install libsecp256k1-dev
$ python3 -m pip install --user ".[gui,crypto]"
```

### Not pure-python dependencies

If you want to use the Qt interface, install the Qt dependencies:
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
```

For elliptic curve operations,
[libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1)
is a required dependency:
```
$ sudo apt-get install libsecp256k1-dev
```

Alternatively, when running from a cloned repository, a script is provided to build
libsecp256k1 yourself:
```
$ sudo apt-get install automake libtool
$ ./contrib/make_libsecp256k1.sh
```

Due to the need for fast symmetric ciphers,
[cryptography](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography) is required.
Install from your package manager (or from pip):
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-cryptography
```

If you would like hardware wallet support,
[see this](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum-docs/blob/master/hardware-linux.rst).


### Running from tar.gz

If you downloaded the official package (tar.gz), you can run
Electrum from its root directory without installing it on your
system; all the pure python dependencies are included in the 'packages'
directory. To run Electrum from its root directory, just do:
```
$ ./run_electrum
```

You can also install Electrum on your system, by running this command:
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools python3-pip
$ python3 -m pip install --user .
```

This will download and install the Python dependencies used by
Electrum instead of using the 'packages' directory.
It will also place an executable named `electrum` in `~/.local/bin`,
so make sure that is on your `PATH` variable.


### Development version (git clone)

_(For OS-specific instructions, see [here for Windows](contrib/build-wine/README_windows.md),
and [for macOS](contrib/osx/README_macos.md))_

Check out the code from GitHub:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/bitnet-io/electrum-bitnet
$ cd electrum-bitnet
$ git submodule update --init
```

Run install (this should install dependencies):
```
$ python3 -m pip install --user -e .
```

Create translations (optional):
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-requests gettext qttools5-dev-tools
$ ./contrib/pull_locale
```

Finally, to start Electrum:
```
$ ./run_electrum
```

### Run tests

Run unit tests with `pytest`:
```
$ pytest electrum/tests -v
```

To run a single file, specify it directly like this:
```
$ pytest electrum/tests/test_bitcoin.py -v
```
